# Time Series Anomaly Detection with Traditional Method

<P>Tools: Google Colaboratory</P>

## Project Introduction

<p>This project is a personal initiative aimed at identifying unusual transaction patterns that deviate from normal behavior to detect potential fraud early.</p>

**Dataset**
<P>The dataset that I used from kaggle.</P>

**Methods**
<p>This project employs anomaly detection techniques to spot outliers and suspicious activities.</p>

## Recommendation
<p>Based on the analysis, we can conduct a deeper investigation into each anomaly point to determine the specific causes of the spikes or drops. If the anomalies are caused by errors or undesirable activities, we should consider taking corrective actions to address those issues. On the other hand, if the anomalies are the result of desired activities (such as successful promotions), this analysis can be used as a guide to replicate those strategies in the future.</p>
